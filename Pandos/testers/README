This folder contains the following Phase 3 (xxx.c) test programs:

Most of the programs record their progress via terminal output (SYS12).
It is a simple matter to modify any of these programs to write to the 
printer (SYS11) instead.

Furthermore, all but one terminate via a call to SYS9. One (timeOfDay)
terminates by forcing a privileged instruction program trap.

These files are compiled and correctly linked via the included Makefile.
The Makefile also instantiates a flash device for each program (xxx.umps file)
and loads the corresponding load image on the device.

Hence xxx.c is a given test's source file, while xxx.umps is the corresponding
flash device "file" loaded with xxx's load image.

NOTE: All these test programs must include the libumps.h header file. Since its
installation location varies depending on the uMPS3 method of installation (from
a package manager or from source), these files include a local .h file (localLibumps.h)
Simply edit this file for the correct location of libumps.h for your installation.

The two most likely locations are:
	For installation via a package manager
		"/usr/include/umps3/umps/libumps.h"

	For from source
		"/usr/local/include/umps3/umps/libumps.h"

Five different versions of a recursive Fibonacci Calculator;

	Fib(7), Fib(8), Fib(9), Fib(10), Fib(11)

Eight different versions of a Terminal tester:
Each program write two lines of output to the terminal before terminating

---

printerTest is identical to a terminalTest only it writes one line of
output to the terminal and same line of output to the printer.

---

asciiArt: In addition to printing instructions to the terminal,
this program writes thousands of characters to the printer - an ascii
art version of Steve McQuinn's face.

---

strConcat: A more complicated test of terminal input (SYS13) and terminal.

---

swapStress: This program exercises the pager by forcing the use of 10 different
additional pages. Each page is written to and most likely forced out of RAM. 
Each page is then accessed again to insure the written changes are still present.

---

terminalReader: A simpler test of terminal input (SYS13). 

---

timeOfDay: This program tests the Get TOD function (SYS10). Finally, this 
program should terminate by issuing a low-level SYS call in user-mode: 
a program trap exception.
