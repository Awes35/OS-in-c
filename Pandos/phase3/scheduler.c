/**************************************************************************** 
 *
 * This module implements the Scheduler and the deadlock detector. More 
 * specifically, this module ensures that the Nucleus guarantees finite progress
 * by ensuring every ready process will have an opportunity to execute. As a 
 * result, this module includes the implementation of a preemptive round-robin
 * scheduling algorithm with a time slice of five milliseconds. The round-robin
 * algorithm in this module (assuming the Ready Queue is not empty) removes the 
 * pcb at the head of the Ready Queue and stores the pointer to the pcb in the
 * Current Process field. Then, it loads five milliseconds on the processor's
 * Local Timer before performing a LDST on the processor state stored in the pcb
 * of the Current Process. If the Ready Queue is empty, there are a series of 
 * conditionals that need to be examined. If the Process Count is zero, we 
 * invoke the HALT BIOS service/instruction. If the Process Count > 0 and
 * the Soft-block Count > 0, we enter a Wait State. Lastly, if the Process
 * Count > 0 and the Soft-block Count is zero, we invoke the PANIC BIOS
 * service/instruction to handle deadlock. The module also includes several
 * other functions pertaining to process scheduling, such as moveState(),
 * which copies the contents of a processor state in one location to
 * a processor state in another location, and switchContext(), which performs
 * a LDST on the Current Process' processor state.
