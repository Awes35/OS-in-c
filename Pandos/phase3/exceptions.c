/**************************************************************************** 
 *
 * This module serves as the exception handler module to define exception-handling functions that are called
 * by the General Exception Handler. Namely, this module defines a function for handling program trap events-- pgmTrapH(), 
 * for TLB trap events-- tlbTrapH(), and for SYSCALL exception events-- sysTrapH()...in addition to all of the 
 * specific helper functions for various SYSCALL numbers. This module is also responsible for handling
 * Pass Up or Die events.
 * 
 * While the General Exception Handler can directly call pgmTrapH(), tlbTrapH(), and sysTrapH(), 
 * most of the functions within this module pertain to SYSCALL exceptions, and thus the
 * sysTrapH() function is the most developed entry point to this module. It first performs a few
 * checks, such as ensuring the requesting process was not in user mode when the SYSCALL was made
 * and confirming the requested SYSCALL will be uniquely handled (only SYS1-8). It then
 * passes control to the appropriate internal SYSCALL handler function.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that for the purposes of this phase of development, the CPU time used by the 
 * Current Process to handle the SYSCALL request is charged to the Current Process.
 * This is true regardless of whether the Current Process continues executing after the SYSCALL
 * request is handled, because once we return control to the Current Process, the start_tod variable (the 
 * value that the process started executing at) is reset.
 * 
 * We decided on this timing policy as we believe charging such CPU
 * time to the requesting process is the most logical way to account for the CPU time
 * used in this module, as the Current Process, after all, was the process that
 * requested that part of its quantum (and CPU time) be spent handling the SYSCALL request.
