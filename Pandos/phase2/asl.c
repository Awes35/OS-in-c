/**************************************************************************** 
 *
 * This module handles the allocation and deallocation of semaphore descriptors
 * on the active semaphore list (ASL) and the semdFree list. The ASL contains a
 * list of all semaphores that have at least one pcb on the process queue associated
 * with it, while the semdFree list holds the unused semaphore descriptors. Both lists
 * are treated in this module as NULL-terminated, single, linearly linked lists. We 
 * also treat both lists as we would a stack, removing and adding semaphores from the
 * head of the list.
